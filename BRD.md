## 1. Executive Summary

This document defines the business requirements for a multi-tenant Learning Management System (LMS) API designed specifically for Nigerian primary and secondary schools. The platform enables schools (tenants) to manage their full academic lifecycle — from session and term configuration to student assessments, timetabling, and communications — through a structured, role-based API.

The system is SaaS-based, operates on a postpaid subscription model, and is billed at **NGN 500 per student per term**, calculated automatically at the start of each term based on enrolled student count.

---

## 2. Business Context

### 2.1 Problem Statement

Nigerian schools — both primary and secondary — lack affordable, locally-aware digital infrastructure for managing academic operations. Existing global LMS platforms do not account for the Nigerian academic calendar structure (Sessions and Terms), local public holidays, multi-school group ownership, or NGN-denominated billing.

### 2.2 Opportunity

By building a multi-tenant API-first LMS tailored to the Nigerian school system, the platform can serve individual schools, school groups (conglomerates), and government-affiliated institutions through a single scalable infrastructure.

### 2.3 Business Goals

- Provide schools with a self-contained digital academic management system.
- Enable platform operators to onboard and manage multiple school tenants independently.
- Generate sustainable recurring revenue through a transparent per-student postpaid billing model.
- Reduce administrative overhead for school operators through automation (timetabling, billing, notifications).

## 3. Stakeholders & User Roles

### 3.1 Role Hierarchy

```
SUPER_ADMIN  (Platform Owner)
    └── ADMIN        (Tenant / School Manager)
            ├── TUTOR    (Teacher / Instructor)
            └── STUDENT  (Learner)
```

### 3.2 Role Definitions

#### SUPER_ADMIN

The platform owner. Operates at the infrastructure level above all tenants.

**Responsibilities:**

- Onboard and offboard tenants (schools)
- Configure platform-wide settings (base pricing, supported features)
- View aggregated billing and usage across all tenants
- Suspend or reactivate tenants
- Access audit logs across all tenants
- Manage RBAC and permissions (permissions will be an array of resource:action strings, e.g., "tenant:create", "admin:delete", etc)
- Manage platform-level integrations (payment gateway, email provider, video conferencing)

#### ADMIN

The manager of a single tenant (school). Has full control within their tenant's boundary.

**Responsibilities:**

- Configure and manage Sessions and Terms
- Define Term start/end dates and public holidays
- Manage Classes and Course assignments
- Enroll and manage Students and Tutors
- View and manage billing and student subscription counts
- Send communications to all users within the tenant
- Approve or reject Timetable swap requests escalated beyond the Tutor level
- Generate school-wide reports

#### TUTOR

A teacher assigned to one or more Courses within one or more Classes.

**Responsibilities:**

- Manage Courses they are assigned to
- Create and publish Quizzes, Assignments, and Examinations
- Grade submissions and provide feedback
- View student progress within their assigned Courses
- Schedule and host virtual Meetings for their assigned Classes
- Send communications to their assigned Classes and Courses
- Request Timetable period swaps with other Tutors
- Approve or reject incoming Timetable swap requests

#### STUDENT

- Sit Examinations within configured windows
- View their own progress and grades
- Receive communications and notifications
- Join virtual Meetings for their Class

---

## 4. System Architecture Overview

### 4.1 Multi-Tenancy Model

The platform uses **logical multi-tenancy**. Each tenant (school) is fully isolated at the data level via a `tenant_id` scoped to every resource. The SUPER_ADMIN operates outside tenant scope.

### 4.2 Authentication & Authorization

- All API access is authenticated via JWT tokens.
- Tokens carry `role`, `tenant_id`, and `user_id` claims.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) is enforced at the API gateway and service level.
- SUPER_ADMIN tokens carry no `tenant_id` and can access any tenant's data with explicit scope.
- SUPARA_ADMIN and ADMIN must be created with a permissions field (permissions will be an array of resource:action strings, e.g., "tenant:create", "admin:delete", etc)

### 4.3 Service Boundaries (Suggested Decomposition)

| Service               | Responsibility                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Identity Service      | Auth, users, roles, sessions                      |
| Academic Service      | Sessions, Terms, Classes, Courses, Timetables     |
| Assessment Service    | Quizzes, Assignments, Examinations, Submissions   |
| Progress Service      | Student progress, grades, reports                 |
| Communication Service | Emails, notifications, announcement routing       |
| Meeting Service       | Virtual meeting scheduling and session management |
| Billing Service       | Student counts, term invoicing, payment tracking  |
| Audit Service         | Event logging, compliance records                 |

```
Invoice Amount (NGN) = Active Student Count × 500 × Number of Terms Remaining in Session
```

For per-term billing, the formula is:

```
Term Invoice (NGN) = Active Student Count at Term Start × NGN 500
```

#### FR-BIL-002: Student Count Snapshot

- All monetary values are denominated in NGN.

### 7.5 Accessibility

- API responses must be consistent and machine-readable, enabling client applications to meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.

---

## 8. API Design Principles

### 8.1 General

- The API must be RESTful with consistent resource-oriented URL structures.
- All responses must use `application/json`.
- Pagination must be cursor-based for all list endpoints.
- All list endpoints must support filtering and sorting on relevant fields.

### 8.2 Versioning

- Breaking changes must increment the version. Non-breaking changes may be additive within a version.

### 8.3 Error Handling

All error responses must follow a consistent envelope:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "TERM_OVERLAP",
    "message": "The term dates overlap with an existing term in this session.",
    "details": {}

### 8.4 Idempotency

All mutating endpoints (POST, PUT, PATCH) must support an `Idempotency-Key` header to prevent duplicate operations, particularly for billing and enrollment actions.

### 8.5 Rate Limiting

- Default rate limit: 1,000 requests per minute per tenant API key.
- SUPER_ADMIN endpoints: 200 requests per minute.
- Burst capacity: 2x sustained rate for up to 30 seconds.

### 8.6 Webhooks

The system must support outbound webhooks for the following events: invoice generated, invoice paid, invoice overdue, tenant suspended, student enrolled, assessment graded, and examination result published. Each webhook payload must be HMAC-signed for verification.

---

## 9. Integration Requirements

### 9.1 Payment Gateway

- The system must integrate with at least one Nigerian payment gateway (e.g., Paystack or Flutterwave) for invoice payment processing and webhook-based payment confirmation.

### 9.2 Transactional Email

- The system must integrate with a transactional email provider (e.g., Resend, Mailgun, or SendGrid) for all outbound email communications.

### 9.3 Push Notifications

- The system must integrate with Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or a compatible provider for push notification delivery to Android and iOS devices.

### 9.4 Virtual Meetings

- The system must integrate with a video conferencing API (e.g., Daily.co, Zoom API, or Jitsi Meet) to create, manage, and end virtual Meeting sessions programmatically.

### 9.5 File Storage

- All file uploads (Assignment submissions, profile photos, Course materials) must be stored in a cloud object storage service (e.g., AWS S3 or Cloudflare R2). The API must return pre-signed URLs for client-side uploads and secure access URLs for downloads.

### 9.6 PDF Generation

- The system must be capable of generating PDFs server-side for: student report cards, invoices, and timetable exports.

## 10. Security Requirements

### 10.1 Authentication

- All API endpoints must require a valid JWT access token except for: login, password reset request, and invitation acceptance.
- Access tokens must expire after 15 minutes. Refresh tokens must expire after 30 days.
- Refresh token rotation must be enforced on each use.

### 10.2 Authorisation

- All endpoints must enforce tenant-scoped access. A user belonging to Tenant A must never be able to read or modify data belonging to Tenant B.
- Role permissions must be enforced server-side and never derived solely from client-provided parameters.

### 10.3 Data Encryption

- All data at rest must be encrypted (AES-256 or equivalent).
- All data in transit must use TLS 1.2 or higher.
- Student PII (names, contact details, academic records) must be treated as sensitive data and excluded from general-purpose logging.

### 10.4 Input Validation

- All API inputs must be validated against strict schemas. Unexpected fields must be rejected or stripped.
- File uploads must be type-validated and scanned for malware before storage.

### 10.5 Examination Integrity

- Examination attempt tokens must be single-use and bound to the authenticated Student's session.
- Each answer submission within an Examination must be individually persisted, not batched, to prevent total loss on connection failure.
